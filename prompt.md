study handover.md
study implementation_plan.md
pick the one most important thing to do that has not yet been done. That is your target. Concentrate only on the target.
IMPORTANT
* tests come first – add examples to tests.yaml for your target and run the tests. Expect the tests for your new examples to fail – your target does not yet exist in the code
* change existing code to pass the tests
* ALWAYS run the tests after changing the code
* when the tests pass, commit
* after committing, append a short narrative to progress.md, adjust and add to decisions.md, and change implementation_plan.md to reflect your completed target, and any new or unfnished work. We're not going to use handover.md again.
